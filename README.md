# millionsofframes

This code backs www.millionsofframes.com

This mini-project calculates the number of frames a human of a given age has seen.

The default assumption that humans see at the equivalent of 24 frames per second is adjustable. Pick the value you feel is best supported by science!

Millionsofframes.com is motivated by the discussion of sample efficiency in modern (2018) reinforcement learning (RL) research.

In RL an agent or algorithm may need millions or billions of frames to master a particular task. Is this efficient or not? What are the equivalent numbers for humans? This project hopes to provide a lighthearted answer.
